## Introduction

The instructions for this assignment and the description of the dataset are provided in README.md by rdpeng, the course instructor. 

This repo contains a "figure" folder, which contains the plots to be reproduced, also provided by rdpeng.

The repo also contains the files required for this assignment, which are described briefly below. 


## Assignment files

* plotX.R, X = 1:4 - These are the R scripts that generate the four plots. 

* checkfile.R - This is an R script that is called by each of the plotX.R scripts; it contains the required code **for reading
the data** by checking whether the R objects and/or data files required to create the plots already exist; if they do not, it downloads the data and creates the files and R objects.

* plotX.png, X = 1:4 - These are the four required graphics files with the rendered plots.
